Warning (dynamic data element):  When "INTERPOLATED" is selected for the
print method, the print frequency feature cannot be used.  PRINT.Freq is
being reset to zero (disabled) and execution is continuing.
 The GGL formulation is turned on.

[1276]
Warning:  In the dynamic data element, the step size is larger
than the print interval specified in the system data element.  The step
size is being reset so that it equals the print interval.
  PRint.interval = 0.10000000000000E-03
  old MAX.int.step = 5.0000000000000E-02
  new MAX.int.step = 0.10000000000000E-03
NOTE:  The Time Series Global Output element will reduce PRint.interval
       when the Output Rate variable is set to two or more.

Warning:  Prior to assembly the number of constraints, drivers and
initial conditions is not equal to the number of generalized
coordinates.  The assembly algorithm will be executed but the
result will represent one of several possible solutions.
Number of constraints, drivers, I.C's =                   39
Number of generalized coordinates     =                   36

[1516]
Warning: Prior to the assembly analysis one or more constraints are not
satisfied within the specified assembly tolerance.  The assembly analysis will
attempt to adjust the model to achieve this tolerance across all constraints.
If assembly analysis fails, or if the model assembles to an undesired position
the following elements whose constraint residuals exceed the specified assembly
tolerance should be checked:
